        <h1>Trump under fire for racially-charged tweets against congresswomen</h1>
        <div>
            <b>US President Donald Trump has been accused of racism after posting tweets attacking Democratic
                congresswomen.</b>
            <p>He claimed the women "originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total
                catastrophe",
                before suggesting they "go back".</p>
            <p>He then said Speaker <q>Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel
                    arrangements</q>.
            </p>
            <p>It comes a week after Ms Pelosi clashed with <q>the squad</q>, a group of four left-wing Democrat women
                of
                colour.</p>
            <p>Of the four congresswomen, three - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley - were
                born
                and raised in the US, while the fourth, Ilhan Omar, moved to the US as a child.</p>
            <p>Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital
                where Mr Trump himself was born.</p>

            <h2>What did the president say?</h2>
            <p>In a three-tweet thread, Mr Trump accused the congresswomen of <q>viciously</q> criticising him and the
                US.
            </p>
            <p>He wrote: <q> interesting to see 'progressive' Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries
                    whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere
                    in
                    the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the
                    people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is
                    to be
                    run</q>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trump scrapped Iran deal <q>to spite Obama</q> </li>
                <li>The White House revolving door: Who's gone?</li>
                <li>Trump retreats on census citizenship question</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came.
                Then
                come back and show us how it is done.</p>
            <p>These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very
                happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!</p>
